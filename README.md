# Bowling Kata



A program that parses a bowling score string and gives you a score
This game will accept a standard bowling score string with 10 frames and return an int with your score.

Examples 

- "9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/" will give you a score of 190
- "X818/-9XXX9-9/81" will give you a score of 161
- "XXXXXXXXXXXX" will give you a score of 300
- "invalid game" will throw an exception


all source code is in src/main/java/com/kata/bowling
all unit tests are in src/test/java/com/kata/bowling

I have multiple unit tests with several assertions that test several different scores and edge cases

I tested many of my test cases with http://www.bowlinggenius.com
